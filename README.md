# Mingine

Mingine is a toy game engine designed to work out-of-the-box with Visual Studio 2017. 
It is a very simple asset manager + SDL2 + lua. 
It is intended to be a small code base that students can use as a starting point for native game engine development. 
Linux and Mac builds are also supported.
